I made an author's name consist of only one attribte, name,
for simplicity. A better version would be to have first name and
last name, and even middle names.

I rather handle data integrity at the data base level, instead
of the traditional rails way - in the models. In Rails 4.2, however,
data integrity on the data base level is made easier.

Use eager loading on authors when reading in the books for
listing, so we do not have to hit the database one time for each
book.

Add presenter to the view. I very much prefer Ryan Bates way of
(http://railscasts.com/episodes/287-presenters-from-scratch)
dealing with presenters to the draper gem. 

A presenter can be tested in isolation without much effort. A
view too, but with some extra work. I try to test my classes is
isolation as much as I can, without including the rails_helper,
since that slows down things considerably.
